# 42-minitalk
My implementation of project minitalk made at Hive Helsinki. <br />
1. Use `Make` to create the executables for both server and client. <br />
2. Start the server with `./server` command it will print it's process id. <br />
3. Pass servers process id on client and pass any string to it `./client [process id] [string]`. <br />
## Description ##
The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program using UNIX signals. It is an introductory project for the bigger UNIX projects that will appear later on in the cursus.
