# 42-minitalk
My implementation of project minitalk made at Hive Helsinki.
Just start the server which will print it's process id and type that id to client and pass string to it. You will see that string quickly in the server.
`Make` and `./server` and `./client (servers pid) (message to send)`
## Description ##
The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program using UNIX signals. It is an introductory project for the bigger UNIX projects that will appear later on in the cursus.
